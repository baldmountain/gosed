This is my Go language learning project. It's a basic implementation of the
utility sed. I'm not really looking for criticism, but if someone want to help
out turning this int a real sed I wouldn't mind.

I mainly put this up as sample code for others to read. Probably not good
sample code, but it is something.

I decided on the MIT open source license. See LICENSE for more information.

The sed.html documentation is copyright The Open Group and I lifted it from
their site. I used it as a specification and this version implements it.
(Mostly.)
